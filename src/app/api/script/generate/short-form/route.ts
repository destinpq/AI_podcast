Include information on their legal framework, financial management practices, and social impact. Focus on how these charitable endowments support community development, education, and healthcare. Gather statistics on major waqf properties worldwide and their estimated economic value. Investigate recent reforms in waqf administration across different countries.",
    structurePrompt: "Structure a 15-minute podcast exploring waqf boards with 4 distinct segments: 1) Historical origins and Islamic legal principles behind waqf, 2) Modern governance challenges and administrative structures, 3) Economic impact and investment strategies of successful waqf boards, 4) Case studies of innovative waqf projects supporting sustainable development. Begin with a compelling hook about wealth redistribution in Islamic finance, and conclude with future trends and opportunities for waqf revitalization.",
    introPrompt: "Create an engaging 60-second introduction that explains waqf as an Islamic endowment system dating back to the 7th century. Highlight how waqf boards manage religious and charitable assets worth billions globally. Use the hook 'What if there was a centuries-old financial system designed specifically for sustainable community development?' Establish the podcast's purpose of exploring how these traditional institutions are being modernized to address contemporary social challenges while maintaining their religious principles.",
    segmentPrompts: [
      "Draft a 3-minute segment explaining the governance challenges facing modern waqf boards. Discuss the tension between traditional religious oversight and professional asset management needs. Explore specific issues like transparency, accountability, and performance measurement. Include examples from Malaysia's corporatized waqf management model and Turkey's Directorate General of Foundations. Address how digital technologies are being integrated to improve record-keeping and prevent mismanagement of waqf assets.",
      "Create a 4-minute segment examining successful waqf investment strategies. Explain how innovative boards are diversifying beyond real estate into financial instruments, startup funding, and impact investments. Include the case study of Awqaf New Zealand's sustainable farm project that generates ongoing revenue. Discuss how modern waqf managers balance the need for capital preservation with generating returns for beneficiaries. Incorporate expert perspectives on the potential for waqf to fund SDGs in Muslim-majority countries."
    ],
    factCheckPrompt: "Verify all facts related to waqf boards, including statistics on their global value (estimated at over $1 trillion), legal frameworks in different jurisdictions, and historical claims. Ensure accuracy about the Ottoman waqf system and its influence on contemporary models. Double-check all quoted regulations from bodies like the Islamic Financial Services Board and AAOIFI standards on waqf management. Confirm the financial performance metrics of any mentioned waqf investment projects.",
    conclusionPrompt: "Develop a compelling 90-second conclusion that summarizes the key insights about waqf boards' evolution from traditional charitable endowments to potential vehicles for sustainable finance. Emphasize how modern reforms in governance, transparency, and investment approaches are revitalizing these institutions. End with thoughtful reflections on how waqf boards represent a bridge between Islamic heritage and contemporary social needs, with a call to action for listeners to learn more about alternative economic models that prioritize community welfare."

    {
      question: `How do cultural differences impact the implementation of ${topic} across different regions?`,
      answer: `Cultural context plays a crucial role in how ${topic} is understood and implemented. What works in one region may need significant adaptation in another. Successful practitioners recognize these nuances and incorporate cultural sensitivity into their approach, ensuring that solutions are contextually appropriate while still adhering to fundamental principles.`,
      followUp: `acknowledging these cultural dimensions actually strengthens initiatives rather than complicating them.`
    },
    {
      question: `What are the biggest misconceptions about ${topic} that you frequently encounter?`,
      answer: `One common misconception is that ${topic} is only relevant in specific contexts or communities. In reality, the principles underlying this field have universal applications that can be adapted to diverse settings. Another misconception is that traditional and modern approaches are inherently incompatible, when in fact the most successful initiatives often blend elements of both.`,
      followUp: `educating stakeholders about these misconceptions is often the first step toward meaningful engagement.`
